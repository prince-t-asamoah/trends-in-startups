# Trends in Startups

Howdy! Itâ€™s your first day as a [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) reporter.
Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a **project.sqlite** file that contains a table called startups.  
It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

Queries in this project will help you retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.
